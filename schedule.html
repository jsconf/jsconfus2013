	<h1><i>Schedule</i></h1>
	<p>Please note that this schedule is tentative and may change at any point in time leading up to the event.</p>

	<h4>All Week Twitter Bikes</h4>
	<p>Twitter Bikes will allow you to journey around the property on approximately seven miles of bicycle trails that will take you to some of Amelia Island Plantation's points of interest such as Aury Island, Drummond Point Park and Walker's Landing. Plantation trail maps and bikes are available at Amelia's Wheels, just pick one up when you need/want one.</p>

	<h3>Tuesday May 28th, 2013</h3>
	<h4>Nokia Shuttles from Jacksonville International Airport to Amelia Island</h4>
	<p>Unless arriving by private jet, Amelia Island is quite remote and that is a very good thing for our purposes. Unfortunately it does make getting here a little complex, but to make it a little easier Nokia will be providing shuttles from the airport on a schedule interval. Details will be out shortly as well as the times the shuttle will run after we have a rough manifest of when everyone is arriving.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://cssconf.com/">CSSConf</a> 9:00AM - 6:00PM</h4>
	<p>CSSConf is among the first of its kind: a conference dedicated to CSS and the developers and engineers who build the world’s most engaging user interfaces. Rather than focusing on design, this conference focuses on the latest technologies, cutting edge techniques, and tools. Perhaps more importantly, CSSConf will build the kind of community in CSS that JSConf has built around JavaScript, and connect the two communities in a way that has been missing until now.</p>

	<h4>Microsoft/IE Reach the Beach Welcome Reception TENTATIVELY 6:00PM - 9:00PM</h4>
	<p>After a long day of travel, come down to the beach for an evening welcome reception and social gathering. Meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy the sand between your toes! We will have various things going on during this event including light appetizers, refreshments, and possibly a little bit of live music. Help us kick off the JSConf 5th year reunion in true beach style.</p>


	<h3>Wednesday May 29th, 2013</h3>
	<h4>Significant Others Track - 10:30AM - 5:00PM</h4>
	<p>If you are traveling with someone that is a ticketed JSConf attendee, we are happy to invite you to a day of non-JS activities! Tour around Amelia Island area to see the highlights and fun adventures that the island has to offer. The track is made possible thanks to our awesome sponsor <a href="http://www.condenast.com">Condé Nast</a>, but does require registration with a nominal fee opening shortly. It is an incredible time and welcome to significant others of all ages. Full itinerary coming soon.</p>

	<p>A big southern family dinner, done right. This is all we will say until you get there.</p>


	<h4>Yahoo! Developer Network Campfire<br/>TENTATIVELY 9:00PM - 11:00PM</h4>
	<p>Whether you just need a break from the or have a sweet tooth, stop by the evening campfire located on the beach. Pull up some sand, grab a couple s'mores, and enjoy the stars. At last year's JSConf, the campfire was the place where some of the best developer discussions happened and we have no fear that trend will continue. </p>

	<h3>Saturday June 1st, 2013</h3>
	<h4>R/GA Relax.JS <br/>TENTATIVELY 9:30AM - 2:00PM</h4>
	<p>Come enjoy breakfast and lunch food with everyone at JSConf as a final gathering. The internet can be a stressful place and programmers often make it worse, but here at Relax.js you can hang out with some of the best and brightest and have a wonderful conversation over pancakes. Plan the rest of your day, show of some NodeCopter moves, or just discuss semi-colons; whatever your final goals, the key is finish out the event happily.</p>

  <h4>Nokia Shuttles from Amelia Island to Jacksonville International Airport</h4>
  <p>Time to head home and Nokia is ready to shuttle you back to Jacksonville Airport and off to your next destination. We hope you have experience new things, made lasting friendships, and thoroughly enjoyed the 5th year reunion. Maybe we will see you in August?</p>
