  "description": "When asked if I wanted to build a Chrome Experiment: a thing that shows off some of the new technology coming to browsers - of course I said yes! Then promptly I bit off the biggest bite of tech I could get my hands on: WebRTC, two way video, peer connection API, orientation events, CSS3 animations, Three.js: generally a lot of tech I didn't really understand!\nThis talk is about the experience of working with WebRTC for video & data streaming and creating a game with embedded video. How some of the problems I encountered blew my schedule to pieces and perhaps how I could have done things differently.\nSpoiler: WebRTC may actually be more of a mindf**k than AppCache.",

  "description": "I am not an expert developer. I am also not a beginning developer.\nI'm an intermediate developer, and I want to navigate the path from being a mediocre or good developer, to becoming a great or expert level developer.\nHow in the heck do I do this?\nThe tutorial ecosystem of the web is heavily skewed towards beginners, but what about the rest of us?\nIf you identify with these statements in the slightest, then this talk is for you. With ideas from cognitive science, education, and some advice from admired programmers along the way, we are going to explore what it means to be a world-class developer and what we need to do to get there. I'll talk a little bit about the philosophy, attitude, and habits (both good and bad) required for learning how to learn better, and then we will talk about the kinds of skills and knowledge that an expert programmer in general needs. Along the way we'll touch about various myths and cognitive biases about who can and cannot be a great programmer, and leave you with a path to get started. By the end of the talk, I will have proposed a curriculum of topics that should take an intermediate developer and turn them into an advanced one, and special attention will be given to mastery of the JavaScript language.",

Coding is the new literacy and a terrifying number of people in both developed and underdeveloped countries do not know how to program. Worse, enrollment in CS and Engineering programs is dropping, so it seems as if interest itself is waning. What can we do to fix this? ",

No, my friends, it's the offline apocalypse and it is already here! Billions of devices have already been affected and many more will be affected each and every day! Fortunately, HTML5 provides us with weapons like Application Cache, IndexedDB and the FileSystem API to survive the offline apocalypse and have fun doing so. By walking through the building of an "offline first" JS application that is currently deployed across Africa, you will learn how to use these technologies to build robust offline solutions.",

  "title": "JavaScript is Literature is JavaScript",
  "description": "Anyone who thinks Brendan Eich invented JavaScript has probably never read Oscar Wilde. “The truth is rarely pure and never simple” says Algernon in Wilde's Importance of Being Earnest, thus betraying a wary familairity with our favorite language. It turns out JavaScript's highly expressive nature and the infinite posibilities of its syntax made it a favored medium for our literary forebears.\nLast summer I introduced the concept of Literary JavaScript with If Hemingway wrote JavaScript, wherein five famous writers demonstrated their JavaScript smarts. That article generated very positive reactions from both the JavaScript and Literary communities (including write-ups in the New Yorker, Huffington Post and Wired Magazine) and this talk will build on those themes, drawing parallels between the myriad stylistic facets of JavaScript and the kaleidescope of literary genres. There is a serious aspect - I hope to demonstrate that JavaScript's loose structure and lack of boilerplate encourages creativity and is something to celebrate rather than something to WTF about.\nOh, and as an added bonus I'll be unveiling an additional set of recently re-discovered works of literary JavaScript genius.",

  "description": "As developers we spend quite a bit of time setting up routing between client and server components. With the advent of node and simple control flow mechanisms such as promises, we have the ability to easily expose JavaScript functions as remote procedure calls to the client. These simple patterns and helper libraries enable us to build extremely fast backends for our modern web applications.",

Why are there so many people out there for whom present-day JavaScript is Good Enough™? What crucial aspect of JavaScript's identity are they trying to defend? Why do they get so scared when someone suggests new syntax? Can we figure out how to evolve the language without incurring the wrath of their pitchforks and/or torches?\nI'm going to spend half an hour trying to figure it out, and I invite you to join me.",
