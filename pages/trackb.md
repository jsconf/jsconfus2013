# JSConf US 2013 Track B Registration Now Open

One of the most unique components of JSConf US has always been our blend of curated content (Track A - [Yammer Track](http://2013.jsconf.us/schedule)) and our amazing attendee submitted content (Track B - [SpringSource Track](http://2013.jsconf.us/schedule)). Some of the greatest talks from JSConf US have come from the Track B line up and its not surprising once you look at the amazing things everyone is doing. The registration process for Track B is being done, much like it always has, on a first come, first speaking basis - meaning if you are the first to the slot (and provide all the necessary information), then you are speaker for that slot. Your talk can be about anything so long as it conforms to the [Code of Conduct](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct) AND is being presented by a ticketed JSConf US Attendee(s). That is correct, you **must already be going to JSConf US 2013 with a ticket** in your name to be able to sign up for a Track B slot. 

This year, we are trying out a new method, so please read through this to ensure that you properly register for the speaking slot you want AND that your registration is successful. To speak in Track B, please review the [posted schedule](http://2013.jsconf.us/schedule) and find the time slot AND day you would like to speak, for example let us say ["Wednesday 29th at 11:30AM"](http://2013.jsconf.us/schedule#tb-0-1). With your timeslot selected, go over to the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/jsconf/jsconfus2013/issues) for this web site and [find your preferred timeslot as an issue](https://github.com/jsconf/jsconfus2013/issues/13). Now as a comment on the issue, provide the following information:

<pre>
Name: [provide your name]
Title: [provide your talk title]
Description: [provide your talk description]
Image: [provide a URL of your image]
I agree to release any and all audio and video recording and broadcast rights to JSConf for publication
</pre>

You must have every one of those fields AND the name **MUST** match the name registered on your ticket. If you submit a name that is not registered OR any comment without all of the data items including the attribute names and release agreement statement, your submission will be considered invalid and the slot will remain open and available. Once a submission has been accepted, an administrator will try to quickly close the ticket. The first valid submission will be accepted and a note specifying which talk is the valid talk will be made as a comment to the issue upon closing it. After all issues have been closed, we will post the information to this site for all to see. For an example of a "correct and proper" submission, [please see this example](https://github.com/jsconf/jsconfus2013/issues/13)

**A/V Notes** Track B talks are expected to work with a microphone and simple projector connection, if you require anything beyond that, please contact our A/V master, [Ken](ken@jsconf.us), directly as soon as possible. We cannot promise to be able to fulfill all requests, but we can try our best.
