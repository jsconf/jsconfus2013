## [Track B Registration Now Open](/trackb)

One of the most unique components of JSConf US has always been our blend of curated content (Track A - [Yammer Track](http://2013.jsconf.us/schedule)) and our amazing attendee submitted content (Track B - [SpringSource Track](http://2013.jsconf.us/schedule)). Some of the greatest talks from JSConf US have come from the Track B line up and its not surprising once you look at the amazing things everyone is doing. The registration process for Track B is being done, much like it always has, on a first come, first speaking basis - meaning if you are the first to the slot (and provide all the necessary information), then you are speaker for that slot. Your talk can be about anything so long as it conforms to the [Code of Conduct](http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct) AND is being presented by a ticketed JSConf US Attendee(s).

## [Changing the Game - Results Of #15ForAda](/5kforada)

[JSConf US 2013](http://2013.jsconf.us) attendees and organizers raised $5,000 for the Ada Initiative, who advised the organizers on how to attract more women and improve diversity overall. Attendees contributed $2,550 directly, and the JSConf organizational team matched 50% of attendee donations, as well as donating a further $1,175 to bring the total to $5,000. The JSConf organizers hope to set a strong precedent for other conferences by becoming an active agent for positive social change.

## [JSConf US 2013 Tickets](/how-to-ticket)

One of the most exciting and often complained about items of JSConf is the scarcity of tickets and the process of procuring them. This is a natural problem that occurs with each successful year of running JSConf as more people both become interested in JS and aware of JSConf. This year we are trying out a completely new way of registering for tickets for JSConf US 2103.
