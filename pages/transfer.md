# JSConf US 2013 Tickets

JSConf US 2013 tickets went on sale and were sold entirely by December 25<sup>th</sup>, 2012 according to the well [detailed description available here](http://2013.jsconf.us/how-to-ticket). Individuals who have tickets may tranfer those tickets to other individuals, but both parties are responsibile for:

1. Handling all finanical transfer details between themselves. JSConf US will not have any part in the financial matters of the transfer.
2. Notifying JSConf US of the tranfser by emailing us directly with the ALL of the following information:
  * Previous Ticketed Individual Name
  * Previous Ticketed Individual Email Address
  * Transferring Ticket Reference/Confirmation Code (available on your ticket's receipt)
  * Transfering To Individual Name
  * Transfering To Individual Email
3. Once the JSConf US transfer team has completed the transfer, they will email you a unique URL that must be filled out with new attendee's information. If this is not filled out, you **WILL NOT** be registered and will not have the proper things for when you arrive at JSConf.

## How do I find people looking for a transfer?

We have tried various methods including waiting lists and mailing lists, but they have caused way too much workload for us.We, the organizers, are not here to facilitate transfers of tickets -- we tried, but there is just too much involved. We have setup a [JSConf community on Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/communities/108690140179099971045) that we strongly encourage you to use for finding people to transfer your ticket to. Please limit your volume of posts and do not spam the community, that is just uncool. Once you have connected with someone, please follow the instructions above.
