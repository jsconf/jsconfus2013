# JSConf US 2013 Wrap Up

We want to start with a huge THANK YOU to all those that attended, supported, and helped make JSConf US 2013 such an incredible event. This year we tried many new things, the least of which was an entirely new conference model and by your feedback and blog posts, it was well worth the risk. JSConf has always stood out from other conferences because of its unique focus on social interactions over raw lectures, but this year took that to a new level. We are very proud of every talk, every breakout, and every new and rekindled friendship that occurred during the 6 days of [CSSConf](http://cssconf.com) and [JSConf US](http://2013.jsconf.us). The overall event truly felt like a big family reunion, which is exactly what we were hoping to inspire. Thank you for being an amazing community.  A community that we are happy to have been there from the start to this point and ongoing for the very bright future before us.

<p style="text-align: center"><font style="font-size: 200%; font-weight: bold;">THANK YOU!</font></p>


Much like the first JSConf US, there has been an incredible outpouring of blog posts about how the event looked, felt, and worked. If you haven't yet written one or are sitting half way through one, please, please, __please__ finish it. These posts mean the world to us and we love hearing thoughtful, meaningful, and personal accounts of the event from your perspective. After posting, please just send us a tweet and we will include it in the library of links below. We thank you for taking the time to write out your thoughts, feelings, and impressions of JSConf US 2013.

Finally, I (Chris Williams) want to take a quick second of your time and thank my wonderful co-curator and wife, [Laura Williams](http://twitter.com/lwilliams). Her diligence, perseverance, and dedication to our personal relationship and the larger JSConf community and events are what allows this to continue and to grow. She is a vital part of JSConf and an unspoken pillar in the JS community, not for writing code, but for bringing us all together to build something bigger than code ever could. Thank you Laura for you time, effort, and support through the last five years, I, and the community, greatly appreciate everything.

Thank you to everyone that has been a part of JSConf over the last five years. Thank you for every wonderful thing you have shown us, you are truly an amazing community of wonderful people. Below are the past five year's of JSConf US family photos, it is amazing how we have grown. We hope to see you once again in Amelia Island for [RobotsConf](http://robotsconf.com) on December 6-7, 2013 and JSConf US 2014 on May 28 - 30, 2014.

<3z
