	<p>Please note that this schedule is tentative and may change at any point in time leading up to the event.</p>

	<h4>All Week Twitter Bikes</h4>
	<p>Twitter Bikes will allow you to journey around the property on approximately seven miles of bicycle trails that will take you to some of Amelia Island Plantation's points of interest such as Aury Island, Drummond Point Park and Walker's Landing. Plantation trail maps and bikes are available at Amelia's Wheels, just pick one up when you need/want one.</p>

	<h3>Tuesday May 28th, 2013</h3>
	<h4>Nokia Shuttles from Jacksonville International Airport to Amelia Island</h4>
	<p>Unless arriving by private jet, Amelia Island is quite remote and that is a very good thing for our purposes. Unfortunately it does make getting here a little complex, but to make it a little easier Nokia will be providing shuttles from the airport on a schedule interval. Details will be out shortly as well as the times the shuttle will run after we have a rough manifest of when everyone is arriving.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://cssconf.com/">CSSConf</a> 9:00AM - 6:00PM</h4>
	<p>CSSConf is among the first of its kind: a conference dedicated to CSS and the developers and engineers who build the world’s most engaging user interfaces. Rather than focusing on design, this conference focuses on the latest technologies, cutting edge techniques, and tools. Perhaps more importantly, CSSConf will build the kind of community in CSS that JSConf has built around JavaScript, and connect the two communities in a way that has been missing until now.</p>

	<h4>Microsoft/IE Reach the Beach Welcome Reception TENTATIVELY 6:00PM - 9:00PM</h4>
	<p>After a long day of travel, come down to the beach for an evening welcome reception and social gathering. Meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy the sand between your toes! We will have various things going on during this event including light appetizers, refreshments, and possibly a little bit of live music. Help us kick off the JSConf 5th year reunion in true beach style.</p>


	<h3>Wednesday May 29th, 2013</h3>
	<h4>Significant Others Track - 10:30AM - 5:00PM</h4>
	<p>If you are traveling with someone that is a ticketed JSConf attendee, we are happy to invite you to a day of non-JS activities! Tour around Amelia Island area to see the highlights and fun adventures that the island has to offer. The track is made possible thanks to our awesome sponsor <a href="http://www.condenast.com">Condé Nast</a>, but does require registration with a nominal fee opening shortly. It is an incredible time and welcome to significant others of all ages. Full itinerary coming soon.</p>

	<h4>Bloomberg Putt-Putt Cookout TENTATIVELY 7:00PM - 10:00PM</h4>
	<p>After a great day of talks, stop by for some hamburgers (or veggie burgers) and hot dogs at the Heron's Cove just outside the hotel. Have dinner, chat about the day, and challenge your friends to a round of Putt-Putt golf. If putt-putt isn't your cup of tea, then stop by the <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/findahotel/ameliaisland/dining/thefalconsnest.aspx">Falcon's Nest</a> for some billiards or just relaxing by the TV, no matter what there is something you can have a blast doing!</p>


	<h4>Yahoo! Developer Network Campfire<br/>TENTATIVELY 9:00PM - 11:00PM</h4>
	<p>Whether you just need a break from the dinner or have a sweet tooth, stop by the evening campfire located on the beach. Pull up some sand, grab a couple s'mores, and enjoy the stars. At last year's JSConf, the campfire was the place where some of the best developer discussions happened and we have no fear that trend will continue. </p>

	<h4>NodeJitsu NodeCopter Event<br/> 9:00AM - 6:00PM</h4>
	<p>Team up (or go solo) to hack a quadcopter using node.js to make a flying robot do your bidding. The NodeCopter event originally launched at JSConf EU and now we take it to the next level at JSConf US 2013. This event will be from 9AM to 6PM.</p>

	<p>Want to be outside, but still need access to the internet? Come on down to the amazing pooldeck where you can get a nice cold drink, a bit of food, wifi, and, when too hot, jump in the pool or hot tub. Brand new, the pool is the gem of the entire resort - even if you are on other events, you have to stop by the pool for a bit. Who knows, you may even catch a repeat of synchronized.swimming.js.</p>

	<h4>Beachside with Atlassian <br/>9:00AM - 6:00PM</h4>
	<p>Hot sun, warm sand, and incredible ocean water - come down to the beach where there will be chairs, cabanas, and umbrellas for you to enjoy.

Other such fun items (buckets, shovels, etc) will be available and ready for you to craft an epic sand castle or catch a wave!</p>


	<h4>Github Golf Tournament<br/>Starting at 9:00AM</h4>
	<p>Take advantage of the world-class Amelia Island golf course overlooking the ocean.

	<h4>Kayaking with Mozilla down the Amelia River <br/>Tours run for 2 hours from 9:00AM - 6:00PM</h4>

	<h4>R/GA Relax.JS <br/>TENTATIVELY 9:30AM - 2:00PM</h4>
	<p>Come enjoy breakfast and lunch food with everyone at JSConf as a final gathering. The internet can be a stressful place and programmers often make it worse, but here at Relax.js you can hang out with some of the best and brightest and have a wonderful conversation over pancakes. Plan the rest of your day, show off some NodeCopter moves, or just discuss semi-colons; whatever your final goals, the key is finish out the event happily.</p>

  <h4>Nokia Shuttles from Amelia Island to Jacksonville International Airport</h4>
  <p>Time to head home and Nokia is ready to shuttle you back to Jacksonville Airport and off to your next destination. We hope you have experience new things, made lasting friendships, and thoroughly enjoyed the 5th year reunion. Maybe we will see you in August?</p>
