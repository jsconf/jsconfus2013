  "description": "Javascript is a programming language, but what kind of language is it? How did it become what it is? Is it 'the right tool for the job'? Does it even matter if it is the right tool or not? Is it improving or getting worse? Do we know what to expect from its future? Do we even know what we want from its future? And if we do, can we influence it?",

  "description": "WebSockets have been with us for quite a while, but there are still people using ancient browsers or being held back by selfish proxies. Because of that, it's difficult to find out which type of connection is best for a client, so Pusher needed a flexible way to tell clients how to establish a real-time connection efficiently and also monitor their behaviour. This talk will give you an overview on how it works, what interesting metrics we got out of it and how we evaluated them. # Agenda 1. Why can't we just stick with WebSockets? 2. Why Websockets are generally superior? 3. Why doesn't Pusher just change JS on the fly? 4. Goals: a) improve initial connection latency, b) provide clients with best possible transport, c) keep costs reasonable, d) get to know our connections, e) have another way to balance the load. 5. Design of our connection strategy mechanism. 6. Our awesome JSON DSL for specifying strategies. 7. Modifying client behaviour on the fly. 8. Pushing client status as a timeline. 9. Interesting stats and what we learned from them.",

  "description": "Web apps have proven to be a solid foundation for many tasks that were reserved for 'serious' desktop apps not that long ago. Their complexity grows rapidly making codebase hard to grasp. Errors during implementation are inevitable (at least for us - humans ;) ). As application grows, probability of unwanted effects and regression is becoming a real issue that can ruin project in a long term. Furthermore, development cycle that does not give immediate feedback to development team about effects of changes on the application behavior makes them unaware of the real effects of their code modifications. As if this was not enough, web developers need to live in an ecosystem of diversified browsers on which their app might be used. Solutions to such problems are available to the public as an open source projects. Selenium has been created to imitate real user behavior as closely as possible. Creating integration tests as a part of development process is really fun as it's basically writing code in your favorite language. During my talk I will present optimal development cycle for rich user interface apps, show the difference between unit and integration tests, show how to start your first test, talk about best practices, show both pros and cons, present handful tools that will make creating tests even easier, share some tips that will make you tests rock and make a little sneak peak into the future of test automation!",

  "title": "So you wanna make a jQuery plugin… jHERE deconstructed.",
  "description": "Out there on the Internet web developers can find a big universe of jQuery plugins for any need you can think of. Do you need a tooltip? There's a plugin for that. Do you need to handle cookies? There's a plugin for that. Do you want a map in your website? You are in luck, there's jHERE for that! Why do people create all these plugins? Mostly because they need a reusable component that can be easily be included into their web apps. So they build it, and then they are nice enough to make it available to everybody. A few months back I created jHERE, with the goal of providing a super simple API for something usually complicated: maps. With jHERE you can create maps, markers, info bubbles, heatmaps and even render KMLs with one line of code. To make life easier for the users, jHERE is however quite a complex jQuery plugin. First of all it depends on a 3rd-party API (HERE Maps) that is lazy-loaded when the plugin is first instantiated. Additionally it was built to work not only with jQuery, but with other jQuery-compatible APIs as well, e.g. Zepto.js and Tire.js. Finally, jHERE is extensible. In order to save bytes, only a small set of simple functionalities is included in the core. More advanced features can be added by writing extensions. This talk is about the journey from the first prototype of jHERE to the final, polished version of the plugin. I will start with the basics of writing a jQuery plugin, I will dive into leveraging Promises/Deferreds when 3rd-party libraries are required for the plugin to work, and I will show how to write the minimum amount of code that is essential to guarantee compatibility with other jQuery-like libraries. Then I will go into extensibility and talk about a way to support plugins for a plugin. And finally, how can you make sure a piece of code maintains the right behavior after you make changes and across releases? You can't, unless you write tests for it, so we'll have a look at unit testing for jQuery plugins. I promise you will see quite some code but also pretty slides.",

In my free time I work on jHERE, my open source jQuery plugin that helps developers embedding beautiful maps in their websites and web apps. Since I believe coding is mostly fun, I work on many other - often crazy - side projects, as you can tell by looking at my Github account."

A dependency is missing here; we have a hard to mock object there; and so on. What is _that_ thing we might be doing wrong but we fail to notice? In this talk we will argue that the problem lays in our code, in its structure, in the way we pass data around and even how we write for loops!

  "title": "You are not service-oriented enough",
  "description": "The UNIX philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well applies to web apps as well. Ruby gems, NPM and all of their cousins are great for modularizing code. Yet most developers bundle dozens after dozens of modules together into monolithic projects when building their customer facing products. It is true for the servers and it is especially true for clients. But what if there was a way to truly stick to the UNIX philosophy? What if we could pipe products together on the highest level and not just on the module level? This talk will show you a way of doing this. It will be a roller-coaster ride through service-oriented architecture, showing you common problems as well as some cool ideas you can start using right away!",

  "title": "An introduction to Knockout.js",
  "description": "New generation browsers are virtual machines in which you can run real javascript applications. That means that the size of your javascript code is growing fast and its design must be maintainable during its lifetime using the same patterns that we apply to our server side code. Knockout.js is a javascript library that implement the MVVM pattern on the client side of your web applications using the well known pattern and a strong binding engine that keeps your data synchronized with the view. During the session we will see how to use knockout.js with our web applications, with examples, tips and consideration about its use.",

  "description": "Description: JS developers must deal with asynchronous programming everyday. This is a complex subject and one of the most common causes of spaghetti code and hard to maintain code bases, specially if they are large. In this talk I'll highlight the main problems of callback based programming, then we will explore some tools to solve this problems like AsyncJS and the promises approach. Finally we will discover that promises are not our last tool against asynchronous problems. Contents: Continuation Passing Style (callback hell), Some functional programming can help us, Asynchronous control flow (probably I'll use AsyncJS to illustrate some examples), Promises, Promises are not silver bullets, Event Streams (a.k.a. Reactive Programming)",

Some of my areas of expertise are JS, REST, noSQL, compilers, object oriented programming and functional programming. As an agile practitioner, I use TDD/BDD and emergent design in my every day work and tries to travel light. With experience in both front end and server side development, I think of myself as a full stack engineer. Although I've worked with several technical stacks, including JAVA/JEE, in 2005 I fell in love with JS. Since then I focus on working with JS and HTML5. Nowadays I'm very happy to be able to apply my JS knowledge to the server side thanks to projects like NodeJS. Self published writer, I'm writing what seems to be the first book about REST APIs design in spanish at lean pub (https://leanpub.com/introduccion_apis_rest). In my free time run a (kind of controversial) blog in spanish about software engineering: http://eamodeorubio.wordpress.com/ Currently I'm collaborating with Agilar (http://www.agilar.org/) as a XP Coacher & Trainer, and recently I became the CTO of a startup called HipHunters (a fashion social network). An active member of the JS community, I'm cofounder and coorganizer of MadridJS local developers group (http://www.meetup.com/madridjs/) and the SpainJS international conference (http://spainjs.org/)."

  "description": "When it comes to deciding what technologies to use in creating a cross-platform mobile app, there’s plenty to choose from.  Each has their own benefits, but to be able to target all the major platforms with ease, such as iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone requires a highly capable application framework.  This is where Sencha can help. Sencha has been building frameworks and tools built around HTML5 for several years.  In this session you will get a sense for how the Sencha Touch framework, with its MVC architecture, can be easily used for building powerful cross-platform apps, and how Sencha Architect can aid in the overall design and development process.",
