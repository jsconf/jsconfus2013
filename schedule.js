How in the heck do I do this?The tutorial ecosystem of the web is heavily skewed towards beginners, but what about the rest of us?If you identify with these statements in the slightest, then this talk is for you. With ideas from cognitive science, education, and some advice from admired programmers along the way, we are going to explore what it means to be a world-class developer and what we need to do to get there. I'll talk a little bit about the philosophy, attitude, and habits (both good and bad) required for learning how to learn better, and then we will talk about the kinds of skills and knowledge that an expert programmer in general needs. Along the way we'll touch about various myths and cognitive biases about who can and cannot be a great programmer, and leave you with a path to get started. By the end of the talk, I will have proposed a curriculum of topics that should take an intermediate developer and turn them into an advanced one, and special attention will be given to mastery of the JavaScript language.",

  "description": "Anyone who thinks Brendan Eich invented JavaScript has probably never read Oscar Wilde. “The truth is rarely pure and never simple” says Algernon in Wilde's Importance of Being Earnest, thus betraying a wary familairity with our favorite language. It turns out JavaScript's highly expressive nature and the infinite posibilities of its syntax made it a favored medium for our literary forebears.Last summer I introduced the concept of Literary JavaScript with If Hemingway wrote JavaScript, wherein five famous writers demonstrated their JavaScript smarts. That article generated very positive reactions from both the JavaScript and Literary communities (including write-ups in the New Yorker, Huffington Post and Wired Magazine) and this talk will build on those themes, drawing parallels between the myriad stylistic facets of JavaScript and the kaleidescope of literary genres. There is a serious aspect - I hope to demonstrate that JavaScript's loose structure and lack of boilerplate encourages creativity and is something to celebrate rather than something to WTF about.Oh, and as an added bonus I'll be unveiling an additional set of recently re-discovered works of literary JavaScript genius.",

  "title": "JavaScript in the Trenches",
  "description": "The instant gratification you get when developing in JavaScript is wonderful, and it is fun to quickly write great applications. However, as these applications grow, development starts to feel more like carving code in stone. The code becomes more and more difficult to change and to refactor with confidence without any type information and explicit interfaces. The truth for most of us is that our JavaScript code deteriorates over time. In your quest for the perfect solution, maybe you’ve kicked the tires with TypeScript and thought “this is interesting… how can this help with my large scale projects?\nThis is exactly what my team did 18 months ago. We build on-line development components, such as the TypeScript playground. My team had an existing large JavaScript code base and we started by dipping our toes in the water by using TypeScript for a single component only. Since we were the first TypeScript ‘dogfooders’ we wanted to ramp up slowly and we also had some hard core JavaScript developers in the team that were concerned about losing the instant gratification of JavaScript. As the project evolved our code got more and more infected by TypeScript. Interestingly, we didn’t feel that we lost the good parts of JavaScript when converting the code to TypeScript.\nToday the project is the largest TypeScript code base inside Microsoft with more than 200k lines of TypeScript in production. In this talk we will take a deep look at the journey and show how TypeScript and other technologies like AMD were used to successfully scale up a large JavaScript project that ships in some of Microsoft’s biggest products and services.",

  "description": "JavaScript has a yin and yang, or put another world-religion way, it serves two masters: humans who hand-code apps and libraries, and compilers that generate JS as virtual machine code. No language can serve two such masters for long. Consider C, still hand-coded, used only as a target language \"temporarily\", a la early C++'s cfront. Which one will win with JS? I think hand-coding is closer to God, make no mistake, but I'm concerned about the case that mammon will prevail in the longer run.\nIn this dystopia, hand-coding will die hard, but compilers can out-generate humans and relieve programmers from having to learn and use JS, especially when they know and prefer another language, and definitely (as in the case of 3D games) when they have C++ code to port. Just as in the story of John Henry vs. the Steam-Powered Hammer, a noble human may get ahead in a sprint, but end up dying after the finish line from a burst heart.\nI will present demos of compiled-to-JS programs including 3D games. I'll then do quick dive into the asm.js (http://asmjs.org/) subset of JS generated by Emscripten, and the OdinMonkey all-at-once asm.js compiler built into Firefox's SpiderMonkey engine. I will also present near-term extensions for data and task parallelism in JS.

  "title": "BPM Detection with JavaScript",
  "description": "Digital Signals Processing (DSP) is inherently essential to any signals-based field, be it digital audio effects, computer graphics, or computer vision.  The web has just begun it's foray into accommodating for DSP, becoming increasingly equipped to handle and modulate signals with the advent of technologies such as the Web Audio API and WebGL.  With the basic DSP tools provided by these technologies, we are minimally bootstrapped and able to leverage these tools to implement powerful algorithms and incorporate powerful fields of research.  One such application is the modulation and processing of music signals.  In this talk I will focus on an application that is more complicated than it seems: automatic BPM detection of music.  Due to the complexities of how we as humans perceive sound,  parse harmonics, and \"feel\" beats within a song, BPM becomes a challenging and enthralling problem to tackle.  I've just begun to embark on an endeavor to implement BPM detection in javascript, building upon budding DSP tools in JS and pulling from algorithms hardened by academic research.  I have been digging into academic research papers in the field identifying and categorizing plausible algorithms from simple to complex, separated by effectiveness for differing applications.  I hope to implement a number of these algorithms across this spectrum and compare their effectiveness for different kinds of music and applications.  I believe exposing and providing robust algorithms for BPM detection would be a strong tool and asset towards many javascript-based web (and server-side ;D) applications, whether for categorization purposes, or for something more dynamic like music visualization.I first began my investigation into BPM detection as a way to break music visualization out of its frequency rut to reflect more compelling metrics such as BPM & key, which encode our consumption and perception of music in a different way.  I plan to use my implementations to build out music visualizations that use alternative metrics in a compelling way that reflects (or invokes!) how we emotionally react to the music we listen to.",

Boom, Promises/A+ was born.\nSoon enough, a number of library implementers got together to form the Promises/A+ GitHub organization, dedicated to creating a new standard for JavaScript promises. With great success, we have produced a spec and test suite that have been adopted by most promise libraries across the internet.\nFirst, we'll look at promises from a technical perspective, and how they help you tame asynchrony. But that's only scratching the surface. We'll also show how promises can do much more than just make async code nicer. With ES6 and generators, we can use them to simulate shallow coroutines, or even crazier stuff like promises as proxies for remote objects: the ability to have a virtual object that queues up asynchronous messages sent back and forth over the network or iframe boundaries.\nSecond, we'll discuss one of the most interesting aspects of Promises/A+: how we worked. We didn't join a standards body, but instead formed a GitHub organization. We had no mailing list, only an issue tracker. We submitted pull requests, made revisions, debated versions tags, etc.—all in the open, on GitHub. And, we succeeded! Promises/A+ is widely used today, and has recently been informing the incorporation of promises into ECMAScript and the DOM. We'd like to share the lessons we learned along the way, and speculate on the role such ad-hoc, community-driven, and completely open specifications have for the future of the web.",

  "description": "Have you ever started developing a simple application that only had one or two JavaScript files, and after a short time, you had over a dozen different scripts that you were loading, and if the sequence was even slightly off, things went awry? Everyone hits this point eventually, and the solution is modules!In this session, we'll introduce what a module is and why it matters to you. There are many benefits to modular code development, and we'll cover those at an introductory level. We'll also take a look over the past, present, and future of modules in JavaScript. By the time we're done, you'll have a solid foundation to take away and put to use in your application!Topics to be covered:",
